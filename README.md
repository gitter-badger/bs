Background Subtraction
======================

A collection of background subtraction algorithms, implemented on top of Boost
and OpenCV. 

This project started as an exercise in using the [bgslibrary](
https://github.com/andrewssobral/bgslibrary), then quickly
evolved into an attempt at improving the performance and implementation quality
of some of the algorithms there, and ultimately has become a miniature lab for
experimenting with background subtraction.

All algorithms implemented here are created from scratch, carefully following the
description in their respective papers, which accounts for the implementation
differences with bgslibrary.
